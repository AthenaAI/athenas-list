There are many charlatans spewing non-scientific garbage on the Internet. We‚Äôve done our best to curate those sources out and only include resources that are based on real science. Because of this, there are less resources here than in our other lists. If you know any good resources that we‚Äôve missed, let us know in the comments below.

If you‚Äôre completely new to fitness and nutrition, start with **Start Here**. This should tell you everything you‚Äôd ever *need* to know about building muscle; but if you‚Äôre still curious, explore everything else below. Resources marked with ‚ùóÔ∏è are difficult, and those with üåü are our favorite.
